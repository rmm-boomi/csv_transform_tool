From the file "raw_data.csv" in my workspace, do the following:
- Convert the 'Date of Birth' Column from DD/MM/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format
- Strip any non-numeric characters from the 'Phone Number' Column
- De-dup the file
- Extract the city value from the 'Address' column ('Street, City, State, Zip' format) and put it in a new 'City' column
- Convert to JSON
- Make a copy called "cleaned_data.json" in my workspace
- Then show me a preview of the result
